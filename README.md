# personal-website
My personal website, as well as a framework for building extensible websites for others. Developed with friends
 
# To run as a developer
<ol>
    <li><code>node ./backend/server.js</code></li>
    <li><code>cd ./frontend</code></li>
    <li><code>npm run serve</code></li>
</ol>

When making changes to the <b>backend</b>, you must ctrl + c to end the process and restart the server with code>node ./backend/server.js</code>.
When making changes to the <b>frontend</b>, they will be reflected on the website when running on a local server.
